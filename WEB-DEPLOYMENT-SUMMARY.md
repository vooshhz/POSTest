# 🚀 WEB DEPLOYMENT - QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE

## ⚡ MOST IMPORTANT - How to Deploy Updates

## 📋 What We Did Today (Complete Summary)

### The Original Problem
- Your POS app was built for desktop (Electron) only
- Database didn't work online because web browsers can't access SQLite files directly
- All the `window.api` calls failed because they were Electron-specific

### What We Fixed
1. **Created a web server** (`server-fly-fixed.js`) that handles all database operations
2. **Built a Web API layer** (`src/api/webApiLayer.ts`) to replace Electron IPC calls
3. **Made the app smart** - it now detects if it's running on desktop or web and uses the right API
4. **Deployed to Fly.io** with persistent database storage
5. **Fixed all the bugs** - inventory, transactions, sales, reports, logout

### Files We Added/Changed
- ✅ Added `Dockerfile` - tells Fly.io how to build your app
- ✅ Added `fly.toml` - Fly.io configuration
- ✅ Added `server-fly-fixed.js` - Express server for web version
- ✅ Added `src/api/webApiLayer.ts` - Web API translation layer
- ✅ Modified `src/api/apiLayer.ts` - Now auto-detects desktop vs web
- ✅ Fixed multiple components - changed `window.api` to imported `api`

## 🎯 Your Daily Workflow

### Making Changes to Your App

1. **Edit your code** (any files you want)
2. **Test locally** (optional):
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
3. **Deploy to web**:
   ```bash
   deploy.bat
   ```

### That's literally it! No need to remember anything else.

## 🔴 CRITICAL - Never Delete These Files!

These files make your web deployment work. **NEVER DELETE THEM**:

1. **`server-fly-fixed.js`** - Your web server
2. **`src/api/webApiLayer.ts`** - Web API layer
3. **`src/api/apiLayer.ts`** - Smart API switcher
4. **`Dockerfile`** - Container configuration
5. **`fly.toml`** - Fly.io settings
6. **`.dockerignore`** - Deployment filter

---

## 💾 Database Management

### Your databases are stored on Fly.io at:
- `/data/LiquorDatabase.db` - Product catalog
- `/data/LiquorInventory.db` - Inventory & transactions  
- `/data/StoreInformation.db` - Store settings & users

### To access your databases:
```bash
flyctl ssh console
cd /data
ls -la
```

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If something doesn't work:

1. **Check if the server is running**:
   ```bash
   flyctl logs
   ```

2. **Check browser console** (F12 in browser) for errors

3. **Make sure databases exist**:
   ```bash
   flyctl ssh console
   ls /data
   ```

4. **If deploy fails**, try:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   pnpm run build:web
   flyctl deploy
   ```
